                  timediffs.app runs entirely in your browser. Your timezone selections, date preferences, and other settings are stored only in your browser's URL. This means:

                  Like any website, when you visit timediffs.app, your browser automatically sends some information as part of standard web protocol, such as your IP address and browser type. This information is not stored or used by us. Your hosting provider may log this information as part of standard server operations, but we don't access, use, or retain these logs.
